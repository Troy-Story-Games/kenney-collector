# Kenney Collector VR

Submission for the Kenney Jam 2021. Theme is rotation. We accomplish this theme by having the player rotate cubes to press a button. For each cube the player is rewarded with 1 Kenney asset. There are 50 unique Kenney assets to discover!

This is a VR project. There is no way to play this without a headset. It should work with any Windows headset however we only have controllers mapped for Vive and Oculus Rift. It will also work on Oculus Quest and Quest 2.
